# Floor-Cleaning-Robot
 In this project we propose a floor cleaning robot that can clean the floor according to the instructions given by user. This robot makes the cleaning process fast and efficient as it
receives the commands from smart phone wirelessly through Bluetooth module embedded on it. On getting the commands the robot perform functions like moving in different
directions and mopping the floor. This system proves to be cost effective, low maintenance and reduced human effort which makes it a very reliable product.
floor cleaning robot is a compact robotics system which provides floor cleaning service in room reducing human labor. Basically as a robot it eliminates human error and
provide cleaning activity with much more efficiency. If we clean the floor manually then there is a possibility that the operator will leave some portion of the floor. Also due to
manual labor involved this is time consuming and irritating to clean the floor. This is where the robot comes as an advantage. Also the robot is small and compact in size. So we
can carry it and place it wherever we can on the house. The robot is very cost effective as compared to manual labor involved. The flexibility, time saving and efficiency make
the robot a clean choice for cleaning the floor
